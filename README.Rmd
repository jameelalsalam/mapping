[![R build status](https://github.com/jameelalsalam/mapping/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jameelalsalam/mapping/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mapping is to provide callable key-value tables that can be manipulated as {vctrs}.

## Installation


``` r
install.packages("jameelalsalam/mapping")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(tibble)
library(mapping)
## basic example code

countries <- c("FR", "GR", "IT")
capitals  <- c("Paris", "Berlin", "Rome")

eu_caps <- mapping(countries, capitals)
eu_caps
```

Display:
```{r display}

```


Apply the mapping:
```{r apply}
eu_caps(countries)

```

The keys, values, and keyvalues can be retrieved, queried, and modified:
```{r query}

```



```{r modify}

```


In future, it will go inside a tibble:

```{r intbl}
# tibble(
#  kv = eu_caps
# )
```

```{r indf}
# data.frame(
#   kv = eu_caps
# )
```

Compose mappings:
```{r compose}

```
